# Enhancements

Detail on the enhancements introduced in MKE 4k 4.1.0 includes:



- Augmented the error message the user receives when an upgrade
  failure occurs due the presence of a previous configuration file in the
  ``~/.mke/mke.kubeconf`` directory.



- Certificate data is now obscured in the MKE web UI once it has
  been saved.



- Addition of a static pre-login licensing message that displays
  after the first login and perpetually for unlicensed users.



- Password restrictions integrated in the MKE web UI for length and
  use of white space.



- Telemetry data now contains the MKE 4k version number.

  Example:

  ```yaml
"app": {
     "name": "m***",
     "version": "v4.1.0"
   },
  ```


- Telemetry data now contains the external IP address.

  Example:

  ```yaml
"direct": true,
   "ip": "3***.2***.5***.1***",
   "library": {
     "name": "analytics-go",
     "version": "3.0.0"
   }
  ```


- Telemetry data now contains metrics for individual nodes and
  Kubernetes resource usage.



- Removed the redundant namespace selector under ``Namesaces > New``
  in the MKE web UI.



- Users are now required to enter their current password as part
  of the process of setting a new one.
