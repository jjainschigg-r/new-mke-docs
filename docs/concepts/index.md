# {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} Concepts

{{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} addresses the complexities of modern infrastructure by helping platform 
engineers and developers through a declarative, Kubernetes-native approach to 
cluster management. {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} aims to close the divide between rapidly evolving 
application workloads, especially those powered by AI/ML, and the frequently slower 
infrastructure that supports them. It achieves this goal by utilizing the 
well-established open-source ecosystem, primarily Kubernetes, to offer a modular, 
extensible, and repeatable template-based solution. {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} simplifies infrastructure, 
boosting efficiency, developer speed, and control, so operators can focus on delivering 
applications.
