# Events

Kubernetes `events` are important system-level messages that record state changes, warnings, or other significant
occurrences related to cluster components. They provide valuable insight into what is happening inside your cluster
and are often essential for troubleshooting and debugging.

In the context of {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}}, the KCM (k0rdent Controller Manager) generates events for all major operations and
reflects the current system state. If a {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} installation fails or behaves unexpectedly, these events can help
identify the root cause.

To retrieve all events generated by the KCM controller using the `kubectl` CLI, run:

```bash
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --field-selector reportingComponent=kcm-controller-manager
```

## Event Locations

* Events related to cluster-scoped objects (e.g., `Management`, `AccessManagement`, `Release`, etc.) are stored
  in the `default` namespace.
* Events related to namespace-scoped objects (e.g., `ClusterDeployment`) are stored in the same namespace as the
  corresponding object.

## Viewing Events for Specific Resources

To view events for a Management:

```bash
kubectl events --for management/kcm
```

To view events for a specific ClusterDeployment:

```bash
kubectl events -n <cluster-deployment-namespace> --for clusterdeployment/<cluster-deployment-name>
```
