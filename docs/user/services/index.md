# Deploy Services to a Managed Cluster

At its heart, everything in {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} is based on templates that help define Kubernetes objects. For clusters, these are `ClusterTemplate` objects. For applications and services, these are `ServiceTemplate` objects.

You can find numerous useful applications in the [k0rdent Catalog](https://catalog.k0rdent.io/), or you can create them yourself.
