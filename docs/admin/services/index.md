# Working With Services

{{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} considers applications to be "services".  These services may be traditional services, such
as Nginx Ingress, or they can be user-created applications. To deploy these applications, create a 
`ServiceTemplate` and deploy an instance of it.
