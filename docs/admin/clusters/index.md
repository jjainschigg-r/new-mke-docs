# Working With Clusters

{{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} enables you to create and manage Kubernetes child clusters on a variety of 
infrastructure choices.  You can also "adopt" Kubernetes clusters created outside of
{{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} so that {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} can manage them.  (You can also 
"self-adopt" the management cluster so you can use {{{ docsVersionInfo.k0rdentName }}} to manage itself.)
